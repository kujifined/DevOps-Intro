### Why signed commits matter

By default, Git does not verify an author's identity: anyone can configure an arbitrary name and email address. A signed commit provides a cryptographic proof that the commit was created by the holder of a specific private key, improving code provenance and giving reviewers an additional trust signal. The xz-utils backdoor discovered in March 2024 showed why software supply chains require verifiable provenance; commit signing does not guarantee that code is safe, but it makes changes easier to attribute and audit.
